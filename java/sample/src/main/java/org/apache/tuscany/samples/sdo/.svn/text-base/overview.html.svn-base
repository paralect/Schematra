    <title>SDO Sample Overview</title>

<BODY>
<h1>Tuscany Service Data Object (SDO) Sample Programs</h1> <h2>Overview</h2> 
<a href="http://incubator.apache.org/tuscany">Apache Tuscany</a> SDO samples
are provided here to help users learn SDO.
The <a href="sampleProgramContents.html">index by SDO 
subject areas</a> lists the different samples available
to you. These samples provide a starting point for learning SDO and can be
extended and enhanced to experiment with other available SDO features.
Please help us enhance these samples by sending your feedback to Tuscany
mailing list or join us and <a href="http://incubator.apache.org/tuscany/getting-involved.html">contribute to this
project</a>.
</P>
<P>
These samples are coded to the SDO 2.1 API defined <a href="http://osoa.org/download/attachments/36/Java-SDO-Spec-v2.1.0-FINAL.pdf">
here</a>
</P>
<P>
These samples provide a place to begin learning and experimenting with the SDO 
API and programming model.  Developers are encouraged to extend and experiment 
with the current set of samples.  If a sample is unclear, is missing 
documentation, or does not cover a desired area, please send feedback to the 
Tuscany mailing lists, or better still send us a patch or join the Tuscany team 
and contribute back to the <A
href="http://incubator.apache.org/tuscany">project</A>.
</P>
<h3>Running the Samples from a Binary Distribution of Apache Tuscany</h3>
<P>The 
SDO samples have been written to be useful in learning SDO, even without 
reference to the sample source code.  The samples output commentary as they 
execute and key lines of source code are output too. One of the sample programs 
(ExecuteSamples) executes all the other samples in sequence. The binary 
distribution includes the sample source code too, so that you can investigate 
further if you wish.
</P>
<P>
The binary distribution of Tuscany contains a pair of scripts to execute the 
ExecuteSamples program (runsamples.bat and runsamples.sh).  To execute the 
samples first locate the appropriate script for your environment in the samples 
directory of the binary distribution and set the value of the BINARY_BASE 
variable to be the directory in your file system that contains the lib and 
samples directories. Then run the script and take a look at the output. After 
that, copy and modify the script to suit your own purposes in running the other 
samples.
</P>
<h3>Running the Samples from a Source Distribution of Apache Tuscany</h3>
<P>
The 
samples depend on the following libraries
</P>
<UL>
    <LI>
        The samples themselves, the SDO 2.1 API and the Tuscany SDO 
        Implementation
        <UL>

                tuscany-sdo-lib-{tuscany-version}.jar - Tuscany APIs and support

            </LI>
        </UL>
    </LI>
    <LI>
        EMF dependencies.
        <UL>
            <LI>
                common-{version}.jar - some common framework utility and base classes
            </LI>
            <LI>
                ecore-{version}.jar - the EMF core runtime implementation classes (the Ecore 
                metamodel)
            </LI>
            <LI>
                ecore-change-{version}.jar - the EMF change recorder and framework
            </LI>

    <LI>And the StAX API</LI>
    <UL>
        <LI>stax-api-1.0.1.jar</LI>
    </UL>
</UL>
<P>
If you are running these samples as a result of building Tuscany SDO for Java 
from a Tuscany source distribution using maven then these dependencies will be 
resolved by having followed the instructions in the BUILDING file at the root of
the source distribution.
